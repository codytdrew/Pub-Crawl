# Pub-Crawl

Pub-Crawl is an application designed for beer lovers everywhere!  Whether you are a fan of a complex IPA or a simple lager, Pub-Crawl is designed to help you match with a brewery that you probably have never heard of, but you will definitely love.

# Instructions

To get started, simply click on the button, Find your new BEER!, to be routed to the assessment page.  Alternatively, if you have a specific beer/brewery in mind please feel free to search for it in the search field at the top of the page.

On the assessment page, you will be asked to fill out a brief questionnaire including your name, a picture, and your preferences on the unique beer look and flavor you are seeking. There are no "right" or "wrong" answers, these questions are simply in place to help ensure that you find a brewery that will bring you to an atmosphere and taste that you will truly appreciate.

Upon completion of the assessment you will be directed to the last page, which will display your results.  Click on hydrate, and you will find beers from all accross the US.  Sorry, we are still working on an International section.  Keep your eye out for this feature in our next update, later this year.  When you see a brewery you like, press the "Send It" button to be directed over the brewery website.  If you do not see a beer that tickles your fancy, click "I don't want these beers!" and you will be directed back to the survey to try again.
